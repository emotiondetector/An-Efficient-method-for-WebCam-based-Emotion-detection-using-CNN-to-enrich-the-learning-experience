Emotion Detector for E-learning Activities

The goal of our Emotion detector model was to detect the current facial-emotion of the student during online learning class and classify the emotion either into Disappointed, Boredom, Fear, Satisfactory, Engagement, Sad, Surprise, with the aid of Deep Learning concept.
In fact Emotion detection will certainly benefit the e-learning classes to recognize the studentâ€™s synchronization and attentiveness rate.
